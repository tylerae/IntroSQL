# Overview

## This is my intro into the world of SQL. I began with a rough idea of what SQL is and ended with a much deeper understanding. I knew that there were two things I need to learn. One, I wanted to make my own realtionship table. Two, I needed to learn how to write queries in SQL.

# Relational Database

## I downloaded a database that had magazine subscriber data and also data on artists. i used this dataset for my queries but had a desire to create my own relationship database. I created a database that holds information about the Lord of the rings. The model holds LOTR actors, awards, and ratings for the films. They have different connection types and keys

# Development Environment

## I used the MySQL workbench for this project. I was able to create an EER diagram model and preform data queries with the workbench. I found that it was extremely user-friendly but I will need to dive more into importing and exporting data with other programs. Obviously, I worte my queries in SQL and found that it is very simple at surface level. It clicked for me once I started imagining the data as I wrote my filtering statments. 

# Useful Websites

* [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/default.asp)
* [SQL Documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/)

# Future Work

* I want to expand the database tables to have more data
* I want to figure out how to more efficiently add data through scripting
